### January: time to think, design & act

(webinar series)

This post 1st appeared[here][0]

January in Australia tends to be a "quiet" month (if there is such a thing). People are on holidays, the sun is shining, the beach is packed, the beer is cold, the cricket is on and we don't have many lodgement deadlines. It also happens to be the start of the calendar year, so it's the perfect time to not only think about what you want to make happen before 30 June, but also what you want to achieve in 2016 more generally.

So we thought we would re-label January as**"The month of the thinking accountant"**.

A month that is an opportunity for accountants to get a jump start on the competition. A month where you force yourself to take a few hours each week to think about where you want to be in June and December and what it's going to take to get there. It's not just about thinking, but also the action list of what you will need to do the rest of the year. Because there is no point in thinking without action!

So we compiled the topics which, if you think and plan for in January, you'll be running a more efficient and profitable firm by December.

And we came up with 4 key areas that accounting firm partners (or accountants thinking about starting their own accounting firm) should focus on. You, the design of your business, your people and action, action, action!

Together[PracticeIQ][1]and I have devised a 4-part series of webinars that will run every Friday and take you step-by-step through transforming your practice in order to kick arse!

[Join us][2]! If you cannot attend or you won't be around, you can register and we'll send you not only the recording, but the slides and a summary of each session.

[**Reflection + Self Awareness**][3] --- Learn about you and your firm's current status first. This is the key to building the rest.  
Friday 8 Jan, 12.30pm AEDT

[**Design the firm that you want**][4] --- What are your ideal clients, work and systems?  
Fri 15 Jan, 12.30pm AEDT

[**Find the right people**][5] --- Is your team the one that will get you where you want to be; what changes do you need to make, and where do you start?  
Fri 22 Jan, 12.30pm AEDT

[**The DO and the HOW**][6] --- Let's go through the basics of a plan to put all of this together.
